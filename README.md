This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Router v6 where a catch-all route (`path="/*"`) doesn't function properly when other routes are present. The problem is that the catch-all route always matches, even if a more specific route exists. This results in the 404 page being shown instead of the intended page.  The solution showcases a proper method to implement a catch-all route.
